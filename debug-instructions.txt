DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS FOR POWER BI MODEL ANALYZER
==================================================

The application is now running with detailed logging. Follow these steps to identify the issue:

STEP 1: Access the Application
------------------------------
1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
3. You should see the Power BI Model Analyzer interface

STEP 2: Open Developer Tools
----------------------------
1. Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect Element"
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Keep this open to see JavaScript logs

STEP 3: Test File Upload
------------------------
1. Click "browse files" or drag the sample-model.json file
2. Watch both:
   - Browser Console (F12 -> Console tab) for frontend logs
   - Backend Terminal for server logs

STEP 4: Check Backend Logs
--------------------------
Look at the terminal running the backend server for messages like:
- [UPLOAD] Received file: ...
- [UPLOAD] File size: ...
- [UPLOAD] Generated analysis ID: ...
- [ANALYZE] Requested analysis ID: ...

STEP 5: Check Frontend Logs
---------------------------
Look at the browser console for messages like:
- Starting file upload...
- Sending request to: http://localhost:8000/upload
- Upload response status: ...
- Loading analysis results for ID: ...

COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
======================

1. CORS Error:
   - Look for "CORS" in browser console
   - Backend should show CORS middleware is enabled

2. Connection Error:
   - Look for "Failed to fetch" in browser console
   - Check if backend is running on port 8000

3. File Format Error:
   - Backend will show "[UPLOAD] Error: Invalid file type"
   - Make sure you're uploading a .json file

4. Analysis Error:
   - Backend will show detailed error with traceback
   - Frontend will show specific error message

CURRENT SERVER STATUS:
=====================
